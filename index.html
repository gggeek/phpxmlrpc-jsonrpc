<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Welcome to the homepage of "JSON-RPC for PHP". It is a library implementing the <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/">JSON-RPC</a>
    protocol, written in <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>. It is also known as PHPJSONRPC.<br>
    It is designed for ease of use, flexibility and completeness. High speed and reduced memory footprint are not the main
    goals of the project.</p>
<p>JSON-RPC is a format used for achieving remote procedure calls via JSON using HTTP as the transport. JSON-RPC has its
    own website, <a href="https://www.jsonrpc.org/">https://www.jsonrpc.org/</a></p>

<h2><a id="features">Main Features</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Support for creating both json-rpc clients and servers</li>
<li>Fully automated or fully manual, fine-grained encoding and decoding from PHP values to json-rpc</li>
<li>Support for UTF8, Latin-1 and ASCII character encodings. With the PHP mbstring extension enabled, even more character
    sets are supported</li>
<li>Support for http features including compression of both requests and responses, cookies, proxies, basic and digest auth,
    ntlm auth, https, http2, keepalives (some only with the PHP cURL extension)</li>
<li>Possibility to register existing PHP function or class methods as webservices, extracting value-added information
    from phpdoc comments, including code-generation capabilities</li>
<li>Optional validation in the server of parameter types of incoming json-rpc request</li>
<li>A web based visual debugger is included with the library. It is also available as self-contained Container from
    <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-debugger/pkgs/container/phpxmlrpc-debugger">https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-debugger/</a></li>
<li>Other cool features are delivered with extra packages, such as a <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-extras">
    json-rpc server</a> that automatically generates html documentation of exposed webservices</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The library has been designed with goals of flexibility and backward compatibility. As such, it supports a wide range
    of PHP installs. Note that not all features of the lib are available in every configuration.</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.4.0 or later; 7.4 or later recommended</li>
<li>The "phpxmlrpc/phpxmlrpc" PHP package, version 4.10.1 or later. This is normally automatically pulled in via Composer</li>
<li>the PHP "curl" extension is needed if you wish to use HTTPS, HTTP 1.1 or HTTP2 to communicate with remote servers or
    to use NTLM/Digest authentication</li>
<li>the PHP "mbstring" extension is needed to allow reception of requests/responses in character sets other than ASCII,
    Latin-1, UTF-8</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<h3>API manual</h3>
    <p>Automatically generated <a href="doc/api/index.html">API docs</a> are available online.<br>
    A good way to get started with API usage is to take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-jsonrpc/tree/master/demo">demo source code</a>,
    showcasing both Client and Server use cases.</p>

<h3>Release Notes</h3>
<p>The description of changes in each release is available as part of the distribution. It is also accessible
    <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-jsonrpc/blob/master/NEWS.md">online</a>.</p>

<h3>Changelogs</h3>
<p>Detailed changelogs are available <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-jsonrpc/commits">on GitHub</a> for all releases
    starting with 1.0-alpha.<br>

<h2><a id="demoserver">Online demo server</a></h2>
<p>TBD...</p>
<!--<p>A demo server is active at the address <b>https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/demo/server/server.php</b>. It
    exposes functions that can be used for interoperability testing (the full code for the server is included in the
    Git version of the library).<br>
    <!- -You can see the source code here:
    <a href="https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/demo/server/server.php?showSource=TRUE">https://phpxmlrpc.sourceforge.net/server.php</a>
    (the xml-rpc server will activate on POST requests, and display its API on GET requests), and auto-generated documentation
    <a href="server.php">here</a>- -></p>-->

<h2><a id="debugger">Online json-rpc debugger</a></h2>
<p>TBD...</p>
<!--<p>A demo xml-rpc debugger application, built on top of this library, is active at the address
    <a href="https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/debugger/">https://gggeek.altervista.org/sw/xmlrpc/debugger/</a>.<br/>
    You can use the debugger to e.g. query the demo server, or debug your own personal xml-rpc server, if it is accessible
    on the net.<br/>
    If your xml-rpc server is not accessible from the internet, we recommend using the <a href="https://github.com/gggeek/phpxmlrpc-debugger/pkgs/container/phpxmlrpc-debugger">Container version</a>
    of the debugger.</p>-->
